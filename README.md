# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks showcasing my skills in **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model building, and evaluation**.  
It includes hands-on projects using popular datasets such as **Titanic**, **MNIST**, **Housing Prices**, and **Global Air Quality Index**, along with experiments in pipelines, decision trees, and bias in models.
